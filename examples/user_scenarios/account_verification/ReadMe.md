This Ballerina code demonstrates an account verification process that involves both SMS and call verification using Twilio.

## Prerequisites
1. Make sure you have a Twilio account with a valid account SID and authentication token.
2. Set up a Twilio phone number and note down its value.
3. Configure environment variables `accountSID`, `authToken`, and `twilioPhoneNumber` with your Twilio account details.

## Code Explanation
- `generateVerificationCode()`: Generates a random 6-digit verification code.
- `sendSMSVerification()`: Sends an SMS with the verification code to the recipient's phone number.
- `makeCallVerification()`: Initiates a call with a verification code URL.

## Usage
